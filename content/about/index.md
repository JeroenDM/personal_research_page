I'm currently pursuing a PhD in robot motion planning at KU Leuven in Belgium. Besides reading papers, this included programming Python and C++ in large quantities. In recent years whe've seen an increased demand for flexible production. By improving industrial robot motion planning algorithms and focussing on open-source development, I hope that small companies can stay competitive.
